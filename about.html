            <p>"Hii, I'm Keerthana from Thudiyalur, currently I am pursuing my BSc  Computer Science at KG College of Arts and Science.    Alongside my academic pursuits, I've actively engaged in online learning through platforms like Coursera, where I've completed courses in  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, further enhancing my skills in programming and web development. I've put my skills to the test in real-world scenarios, fostering creativity and problem-solving abilities.
                
                As I continue on my journey, I am eager to explore new opportunities for learning and growth, with a keen interest in becoming proficient in frontend development. 
                
                Thank you for considering me, and I look forward to connecting with all of you.</p>
